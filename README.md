Ssh Search Provider
=====================
A gnome-shell extension which searches the ssh config file and the known\_hosts file and provides the found ssh connections in your shell overview.

So you need a ~/.ssh/config file to use this extensions. It parses
the config file and search for the strings after the "Host" setting.

### Installation
Install the extension directly from the gnome-shell extension webpage:
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/73/ssh-search-provider/

or manually

 * copy or link the folder "ssh-search-provider@gnome-shell-extensions.brot.github.com" to ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
 * enable extension (e.g. via gnome-tweak-tool)

### Usage
After activating overview mode, just start typing the hostname. The hosts (from .ssh/config and .ssh/known\_hosts) matching the search term will be displayed. If the search term contains a '@', the part after the '@' will be used to search for a hostname. The part before will be used as username for the ssh connection.

### Selecting Your preferred Terminal Application
At the moment it isn't possible to configure the preferred terminal app directly.
The reason is that gnome-shell in the current stable version (3.2) don't provide
tools for extensions to create extension specific settings. 
With the future version of gnome-shell (3.4) this should be possible and then I 
will provide an updated version of this extension with some gsetting options.

At the moment you could only change the source code directly. So you have to 
change the file ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ssh-search-provider@gnome-shell-extensions.brot.github.com/extension.js

Replace 'gnome-terminal' with the name of your preferred terminal app:

    const SSHSEARCH_TERMINAL_APP = 'gnome-terminal';
    
For example

    const SSHSEARCH_TERMINAL_APP = 'terminator';
